            As twin sisters, we've always had a shared passion for exploring the
            world. But what really ignited our journey was our love for Paris
            and the desire to share everything we know about it. Paris isn't
            just about visiting iconic monuments â€“ it's about discovering the
            hidden gems, the secret spots only locals know, and the unique
            stories that make this city so magical.
